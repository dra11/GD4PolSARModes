# GD4PolSARModes
 MATLAB Codes for Geodesic Distance (GD) and its derived parameters across SAR Polarimetric Modes.
 
 **Three standalone MATLAB scripts** in total:   

*1. CD_QP_simulated_modes_V2.m*  
>Gedoesic Distance-Based Change Detection maps in various SAR polarimetric modes simulated from two coregistered Quad Polarimetric SAR dataset

*2. pars_polm_V2.m*  
>Three Gedoesic Distance-Based parameters in various SAR polarimetric modes simulated using Quad Polarimetric SAR data.

*3. pars_S1_grd_V2.m*  
>Gedoesic Distance-Based parameters for Sentinel-1 GRD images (Tested for sea ice in EW mode)  

(Simply launch in MATLAB editor, read inset initial comments and run. :smiley:)
